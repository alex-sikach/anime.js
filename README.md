choose the level, u'll need it later.

use arrows up, down, left and right to move the 3 squares and modify them.
u can use the combination Ctrl+Enter to the 3 squares make spin themselves.
click the key "s" to paint the waterfall in yellow and "w" to paint back in blue.
and finally main game - u have a game field by hovering the black square (player) start to move. it's speed depend of level that you've chosen. if you click on player during it's black - you'll get the 1 point to common score, by click it during it's red - you'll lose the 2 points.
and sure you had to notice the white square with some number. it is a main, common score. when the orange square make a spin - you get the point, when you use the combo ctrl+enter - you get the score, when you make the spin by using the arrows - you get the point also and as i told you - u can get and lose scores in main game.
good luck)
